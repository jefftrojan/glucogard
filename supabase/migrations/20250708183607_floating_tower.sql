/*
  # Enhanced Doctor Recommendations System

  1. Updates
    - Add doctor_id foreign key to recommendations table if not exists
    - Update RLS policies for better doctor access
    - Add indexes for performance

  2. Security
    - Doctors can insert and update their own recommendations
    - Patients can read recommendations for their submissions
    - System can still insert recommendations (for AI-generated ones)
